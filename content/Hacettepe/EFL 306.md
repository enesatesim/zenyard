## Graded Readers
Graded readers are books calibrated to level.

- Controlling vocabulary.
- control grammar.
	- simplify sentence.
	- canonical word order (SVO)
- use illustrations
- simplify the plot
## headword
finish, finished , finishes, all the same

There is no C2 graded reader because a C2 learner has already mastered the language and can read the original.

fluency development is the "i" in the "i+1"
